    "If the Python process has write access on your machine, it will store the byte code of your programs in files that end with a .pyc extension (“.pyc” means compiled “.py” source). Prior to Python 3.2,you will see these files show up on your computer after you’ve run a few programs alongside the corresponding source code files—that is, in the same directories. For instance, you’ll notice a script.pyc after importing a script.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3.2 and later, Python instead saves its .pyc byte code files in a subdirectory named __pycache__ located in the directory where your source files reside, and in files whose names identify the Python version that created them (e.g., script.cpython-33.pyc). The new __pycache__ subdirectory helps to avoid clutter, and the new naming convention for byte code files prevents different Python versions installed on the same computer from overwriting each other’s saved byte code.\n"

    "The next time you run your program, Python will  load the .pyc files and skip the compilation step, as long as you haven’t changed your source code        since the byte code was last saved, and aren’t running with a different Python than the one that created the byte code. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works like this:\n",
    "+ <u>Source changes:</u> Python automatically checks the last-modified timestamps of source and byte code files to know when it must            recompile—if you edit and resave your source code, byte code is automatically re-created the next time your program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ <u>Python versions:</u> Imports also check to see if the file must be recompiled because it was created by a different Python version,using either a “magic” version number in the byte code file itself in 3.2 and earlier, or the information present in byte code filenames in 3.2 and later.\n",

    "+ The PVM is the runtime engine of Python, it is always present as a part of the Python system, and it is the component that truly runs your scripts.\n",
    "+ The PVM is just a big code loop that iterates through your byte code instructions, one by one, to carry out their operations.\n",

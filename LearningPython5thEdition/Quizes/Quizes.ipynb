    "* Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets are generally considered to be the core object (data) types. * Types, None, and Booleans are sometimes classified this way as well. \n",
    "* There are multiple number types (integer, floating point, complex, fraction, and decimal).\n",
    "* There are multiple string types (simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2.X, and text strings and byte strings in Python 3.X)."

    "### 2. Why are they called “core” data types?\n",
    "* They are known as “core” types because they are part of the Python language itself and are always available.\n",
    "* To create other objects, you generally must call functions in imported modules. \n",
    "* Most of the core types have specific syntax for generating the objects: 'spam', for example, is an expression that makes a string and determines the set of operations that can be applied to it. \n",
    "* Core types are hardwired into Python’s syntax. \n",
    "* In contrast, you must call the built-in open function to create a file object (even though this is usually considered a core type too)."

    "indexing, concatenation, and slicing, but also have type-specific method calls. A\n",
